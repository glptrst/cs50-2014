0.  BMP: up to 256 teracolors (281,474,976,710,656 colors).
    GIF: 256.
    JPEG: over 16 million colors.
    PNG: over 16 million colors.
1.  GIF.
2.  The difference is that lossless compressione doesn't degrade the image. 
3.  JPEG.
4.  The operating system modifies the name of the directory entry of the file in order to
    signal that the file has been deleted and that the directory can be recycled. 
    Then all of the file’s FAT clusters are moved to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. 
    The actual file is left untouched. 
5.  Overwriting "with a few random passes" should be sufficient with a today's disk drive. 
6.  stdint.h is a file header introduced in the C99 standard library. It provides a set of typedefs 
    which specify exact-width integer type, togheter with type's minimum and maximum possible values. 
7.  They let the pogrammer write a more portable code. 
8.  BYTE: 1 bytes.
    DWORD: 4 bytes. 
    LONG: 4 bytes. 
    WORD: 2 bytes.
9.  The first 2 bytes of the BMP file format are the character "B" then the character "M" in ASCII encoding;
    0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal.
10. bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    biSize is the number of bytes required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
11. For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB (device-independent 
    bitmap) with the origin at the lower left corner. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB 
    with the origin at the upper left corner.
12. biBitCount. 
13. It would return NULL if the attempt to open the file in write mode fails. 
    We could, for example, have no permission to write in that directory. 
14. Because the number of elements to read is 1. 
15. 3.
16. It changes the file position of a stream. In copy.c it is used to skip over padding. 
17. SEEK_CUR is a constast used as argument of fseek to indicate that the "offset"(other argument) 
    is relative to the current file position( and not the end of file or the beginning of file). 
18. It seems Rob Bowden holding a cat to me.
